/*A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains 
multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly
 greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.*/


/*
Approach:
-----------
We are asked to find a peak element in the array. 
A peak element is one that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

1. Handle boundary cases first:
   - If there is only one element → it is the peak.
   - If the first element > second element → first is a peak.
   - If the last element > second last → last is a peak.

2. Otherwise, use Binary Search on the range [1..n-2]:
   - If nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1] → mid is the peak.
   - If nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] → we are on an increasing slope → move right (low = mid+1).
   - Else → we are on a decreasing slope → move left (high = mid-1).

This works because there is always at least one peak element in the array.

Time Complexity: O(log n)  (binary search halves the range each step)
Space Complexity: O(1)     (constant extra space)
